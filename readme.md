## About

Written in PHP (obviously intertwined with javascript, CSS, SQL and HTML), with a rapid growth speed. (I wrote about half of the project in less than a week!) And with me learning by practising, as I haven't written any HTML in over 2 years.
I have never ever created CSS files! Yet this site has, if I may say so, a very unique styling!</CENTER>
